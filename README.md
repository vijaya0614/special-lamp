~ LOGO Generator
This project uses the stable Diffusion pipeline to generate images from text prompts.The stable Diffusion Pipeline is a machine learning model that uses a diffusion process to generate logos from text prompts.
This is a simple GUI application for generating images based on user prompts using the StableDiffusionPipeline model from the diffusers module. 
The application allow the user to enter the user to enter a prompt,Click a button to generate LOGOs based on th prompt,and vuew the generated image on gui window .
~ GETTING started :
TO get started you will need to install the following dependencies:
>>Pytorch
>>Diffuseres
>>Matpolits
PREREQUISITIES
